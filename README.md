# usaddress-lambda
An implementation of the usaddress python tool for Amazon lambda, with optional USPS address correction.

The actual Amazon Lambda function is in usaddr.py; all the rest of the files are needed to run it in the Lambda environment.
A zip of all these files and folders (not a zip of a folder containing them!) can be uploaded to Lambda.

See usaddr.py for more information on what the app expects.
